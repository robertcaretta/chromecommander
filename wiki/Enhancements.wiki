Ideas for improvement:
 - Editing category titles
 <br>- Enable/disable of links (Toggling)

My research into these requests led me to this demo. http://www.jstree.com/demo  I envision that the information would initially be stored in a xml file. Then all items committed to local storage memory. The jstree would be used to enable/disable links in local storage. 

Further development would be needed on the pop-up screen to loop over the xml file and check against the visibility status in local storage. 

Comments on potential implementation are welcome.
