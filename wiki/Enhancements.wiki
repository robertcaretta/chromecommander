Ideas for improvement:
 - Editing category titles
 <br>- Enable/disable links (Toggling)

My research into these requests led me to this demo. http://www.jstree.com/demo  I envision that the information would initially be stored in a xml file. Then all items committed to local storage memory. The jstree would be used to enable/disable links in local storage. 

Further development would be needed on the pop-up screen to loop over the xml file and check against the visibility status in local storage. 

Not quite sure how minor revisions to xml file would work though. If the local storage is tied to a specific xml ID/node there may be synching issues with local storage. May need to create unique non-reusable identifiers for each link.

Comments/ideas on potential implementation are welcome.
